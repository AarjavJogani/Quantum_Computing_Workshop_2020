# Quantum Computing Workshop 2020

Welcome to our Quantum Computing workshop. So to start off you need an IBM id so that you can use the IBM Quantum Experience.

The notebooks have not been added yet and will be added on 25th of July 2020

You can find the IBM Quantum Experience [here](https://quantum-computing.ibm.com/).

Once you have set up your account you can use the notebooks provided to you by going on the side tab on [this](https://quantum-computing.ibm.com/) page and selecting **Qiskit Notebooks** under the Tools section and selecting **Import** and simply uploading the notebooks that you have downloaded from here.
If you wish to run these notebooks locally you will require **Anaconda** and **Jupyter** which comes by default along with **Anaconda**.

You will also require the packages **numpy**, **scipy**, **matplotlib** and **os** but these come included with **Jupyter** anyway.
To install qiskit follow [this guide](https://qiskit.org/documentation/install.html).

Stay tuned on this repo for more updates!

# MnP Quantum Computing Workshop 2020

Welcome to our Quantum Computing workshop. So to start off you need an IBM id so that you can use the IBM Quantum Experience.

You can find the IBM Quantum Experience [here](https://quantum-computing.ibm.com/).
To download the notebooks you have to select **Raw** and then save as on that page and you will have to choose the save as in all files and it would automatically come as Notebook_name.ipynb.txt so you have to save it as just Notebook_name.ipynb by removing the .txt from the extension. 

Once you have set up your account you can use the notebooks provided to you by going on the side tab on [this](https://quantum-computing.ibm.com/) page and selecting **Qiskit Notebooks** under the Tools section and selecting **Import** and simply uploading the notebooks that you have downloaded from here.
If you wish to run these notebooks locally you will require **Anaconda** and **Jupyter** which comes by default along with **Anaconda**.

You will also require the packages **numpy**, **scipy**, **matplotlib** and **os** but these come included with **Jupyter** anyway.
To install qiskit follow [this guide](https://qiskit.org/documentation/install.html).
On a sidenote running this in one of the cells of any **Jupyter** notebook should also do the trick.
<pre><code>!pip install qiskit</code></pre>
To check if its properly installed, run this code in one of the cells
<pre><code>import qiskit<br>
qiskit.__version__</code></pre>

Once you are done with all this you can start with the notebooks :)

This is the list of notebooks
